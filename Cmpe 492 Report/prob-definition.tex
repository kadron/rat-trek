\chapter{Problem Definition}
Video tracking for purposes of behaviour analysis has been used by the researchers at Psychobiology lab extensively. One such system currently in use is EthoVision (from Noldus Information Technology). Which provides detailed analysis tools to researcher when tracking lab rats. But one limitation of the EthoVision is its inability to operate under lowly lit or dark environments. This limitation became relevant when Prof. Resit Canbeyli enlisted our help in designing a tracking system with similar functionality but can operate under lighting situations representing both daylight and night conditions. This system is going to be used in an experiment where day/light periods are manipulated to observe changes in the rats biological clocks.

Thus we decided the depth images provided by the Kinect made the perfect sensor for the task, as the data is unaffected by any light emission within human visual range.

The problem then becomes finding closed contours in the depth image and tracking resulting objects.
