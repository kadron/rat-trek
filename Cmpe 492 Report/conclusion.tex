\chapter{Conclusion}
We are introducing a system for automatically tracking rat locomotor behaviour for experiment automation. We explored the advantages of using Kinect over classical RGB cameras since this approach allows for the system to operate without concerns over lighting conditions. 

This solution was deemed necessary because the product owners, researchers at the psychobiology lab, require the ability to track and observe subjects in both day and night conditions.

In this document, the effort that was put into this task as of Project Final date is documented. Lastly, planned future work is also described.
